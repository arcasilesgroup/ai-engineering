# Start

## Purpose

Session welcome dashboard. Loads project context, activates instinct observation, and shows everything needed to begin working. Users run this because the dashboard is useful — context loading is a built-in benefit.
This skill is invoked as an IDE slash command (`/ai-start`). It is not an `ai-eng start` terminal command, and no CLI fallback should be inferred unless the CLI docs explicitly define one.

## Process

### Step 1: Load context

Read `session.context_files` from `.ai-engineering/manifest.yml` to discover which files to load. If `manifest.yml` is missing or `session.context_files` is not defined, skip context loading and note in the dashboard: 'manifest not found — run `/ai-constitution` to initialize'. Read each file. Count meaningful data for the summary line (e.g., number of lessons, number of decisions, active risks).

### Step 2: Activate instinct

Run `/ai-observe` to enter observation mode for this session.

### Step 3: Gather status

Collect these in parallel:

- **Active spec**: read `.ai-engineering/specs/spec.md` frontmatter — extract title and status. Spec frontmatter is YAML between `---` delimiters. Extract `title` and `status` fields. If file missing or empty: `no active spec`.
- **Plan progress**: read `.ai-engineering/specs/plan.md` — count checked `[x]` vs total `[ ]` tasks. If missing: `no active plan`.
- **Recent activity**: run `git log --oneline -5` and generate a 3-5 line human-readable summary. Not the raw log — explain what happened in plain language.
- **Board status**: follow the Board Display section below.
- **Instinct proposals**: read `.ai-engineering/instincts/proposals.md` — if it has content beyond the header, count proposals.

### Step 4: Display dashboard

Render the welcome dashboard as raw Markdown — NOT inside a code block. Markdown renders natively across Claude Code, claude.ai, GitHub Copilot, Codex, and Gemini CLI.

Read `name` from `.ai-engineering/manifest.yml` for the project header. Budget: ≤ 50 lines.

Template (output directly as Markdown, replacing placeholders):

````markdown
## ◈ [name]

> LESSONS (N) · CONSTITUTION · manifest (N skills, N agents) · decisions (N active, N risks)
> instinct · observation mode active

---

### ▸ Active Work

- **Spec NNN** — [title] · `status`
- **Plan** — N/M tasks complete | no active plan

### ▸ Recent

- [LLM summary line] (#NNN)
- [LLM summary line] (#NNN)
- [3-5 bullets from last 5 commits]

### ▸ Board · [provider] [project]

- N items — Status1: N · Status2: N
- or: not configured — run `/ai-board discover`

---

`/ai-brainstorm` design · `/ai-debug` fix · `/ai-guide` explore · `/ai-commit` save
`/ai-review` review · `/ai-pr` ship · `/ai-test` verify · `/ai-cleanup` tidy
````

Formatting rules:
- Use `·` (middle dot U+00B7) as inline separator
- Status values in inline code backticks: `approved`, `in_progress`, `draft`
- Plan complete: append ✓ after count
- PR references in parentheses: (#NNN)
- No active spec: `no active spec — run /ai-brainstorm`
- Board unavailable: `board unavailable` — never block the dashboard
- Proposals (if any): add `### ▸ Proposals` section with count and titles (≤ 3 lines)

## Board Display

1. Read `work_items.provider` from manifest. This is the ONLY field that determines which provider to use.
2. Branch on the value:

**IF `work_items.provider` is `github`**:
- If `work_items.github_project.number` is set: read `work_items.github_project.owner` from manifest for the `--owner` flag. `gh project item-list <number> --owner <github_project.owner> --format json --limit 10`
- Else: `gh issue list --limit 10 --json number,title,state,labels`

**ELSE IF `work_items.provider` is `azure_devops`**:
- Read `work_items.azure_devops.area_path` from manifest.
- `az boards query --wiql "SELECT [System.Id],[System.Title],[System.State] FROM WorkItems WHERE [System.AreaPath] UNDER '<area_path>' ORDER BY [System.ChangedDate] DESC" --top 10 -o json`

**ELSE**: show `board provider unknown — check work_items.provider in manifest`.

Show count grouped by status. Keep it to 1-3 lines.

If `work_items` section missing from manifest: show `not configured — run /ai-board discover`.
If API call fails: show `board unavailable` and continue. Never block the dashboard.

## Context Budget

| Section | Max lines |
|---------|-----------|
| Header + context | 4 |
| Active work | 4 |
| Recent activity | 7 |
| Board | 3 |
| Quick actions | 2 |
| Proposals (if any) | 3 |
| **Total** | **≤ 50** |

## Examples

### Example 1 — morning bootstrap

User: "good morning, where did I leave off?"

```
/ai-start
```

Loads context, activates instinct, prints the dashboard: recent activity, active spec, board status, suggested next command.

### Example 2 — mid-session re-bootstrap after `/clear`

User: "I cleared context — get me back up to speed"

```
/ai-start
```

Re-loads project context without rebuilding the conversation; shorter dashboard since recent activity is limited to commits since last bootstrap.

## Integration

Called by: user directly, IDE instruction files (FIRST ACTION mandate). Calls: `/ai-observe` (observation mode). Suggests: `/ai-board discover` (board not configured), `/ai-brainstorm` (no active spec). See also: `/ai-guide` (human onboarding), `/ai-cleanup` (pre-start hygiene).
