# AGENTS.md

## Purpose

Operational contract for AI agents working in this repository.
This file is automatically consumed by GitHub Copilot (agent mode), Claude Code, Codex, and other AI coding agents that read repository-root instruction files.

## Canonical Governance Source

- `.ai-engineering/` is the single source of truth for governance and context.
- Agents must treat `.ai-engineering/manifest.yml` and `.ai-engineering/context/**` as authoritative.

## Lifecycle Enforcement

Every non-trivial change follows:

1. Discovery
2. Architecture
3. Planning
4. Implementation
5. Review
6. Verification
7. Testing
8. Iteration

## Ownership Model

- Framework-managed: `.ai-engineering/standards/framework/**`
- Team-managed: `.ai-engineering/standards/team/**`
- Project-managed: `.ai-engineering/context/**`
- System-managed: `.ai-engineering/state/*.json`, `.ai-engineering/state/*.ndjson`

Agents must never overwrite team-managed or project-managed content during framework update flows.

## Security and Quality Non-Negotiables

- Mandatory local enforcement via git hooks.
- Required checks include `gitleaks`, `semgrep`, dependency vulnerability checks, and stack checks.
- No direct commits to `main` or `master`.
- No protected branch push in governed commit flows.
- Remote skills are content-only inputs; no unsafe remote execution.

## Command Contract

- `/commit` -> stage + commit + push current branch
- `/commit --only` -> stage + commit
- `/pr` -> stage + commit + push + create PR + enable auto-complete (`--auto --squash --delete-branch`)
- `/pr --only` -> create PR; if branch is unpushed, warn and propose auto-push; continue via selected mode if declined
- `/acho` -> stage + commit + push current branch
- `/acho pr` -> stage + commit + push + create PR + enable auto-complete (`--auto --squash --delete-branch`)

## Decision and Audit Rules

- Risk acceptance decisions must be written to `.ai-engineering/state/decision-store.json`.
- Governance events must be appended to `.ai-engineering/state/audit-log.ndjson`.
- Agents must check decision store before prompting for the same risk decision.

## Tooling Baseline

- Python runtime/package tooling: `uv`
- Lint/format: `ruff`
- Type checking: `ty`
- Dependency vulnerability check: `pip-audit`

## Working Agreement for This Repository

- Keep changes small and verifiable.
- Follow active spec via `.ai-engineering/context/specs/_active.md`.
- Include rationale, expected gain, and potential impact in governance document updates.
