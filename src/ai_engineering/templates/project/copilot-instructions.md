## Must Follow

- `.ai-engineering/standards/framework/stacks/python.md`
- `.ai-engineering/context/delivery/planning.md`

## Workflow Contract

- use governed `/commit`, `/pr`, and `/acho` flows,

- keep updates ownership-safe.

## Validation Reminder

Before proposing merge:

- lint/format,
- tests,
- type checks,
- security scans.
