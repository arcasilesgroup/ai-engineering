# Team Python Stack Standards

## Update Metadata

- Rationale: allow team-specific Python conventions on top of framework defaults.
- Expected gain: improved local fit with preserved governance.
- Potential impact: team settings require periodic compatibility checks.

## Purpose

Team-level Python standards layered after framework Python standards.

## Team Overrides

- Add stricter lint rules when needed.
- Add stack-specific test policies.
- Define team templates for docs and code review.

## Constraint

Team overrides cannot weaken framework non-negotiables.

## Ownership Contract

This file is team-managed and is never overwritten by framework updates.
