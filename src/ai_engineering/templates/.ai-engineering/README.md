# .ai-engineering

## Update Metadata

- Rationale: align repository governance structure with finalized architecture contract.
- Expected gain: remove ambiguity and prevent ownership/update violations.
- Potential impact: existing contributors follow new paths and state file contracts.

Canonical governance root for the `ai-engineering` framework and for installed instances.

## Ownership Model

| Scope | Paths | Update Rule |
|---|---|---|
| Framework-managed | `standards/framework/**` | Framework updater may modify |
| Team-managed | `standards/team/**` | Never overwritten by framework updater |
| Project-managed | `context/**` | Never overwritten by framework updater |
| System-managed | `state/*.json`, `state/*.ndjson` | Managed by installer/updater/runtime |

## Template Mirror Contract

- Source-of-truth authoring happens under repository root `.ai-engineering/`.
- The distributable template mirror lives at `src/ai_engineering/templates/.ai-engineering/`.
- Non-state governance files must stay identical between both locations.
- `state/*` remains runtime-generated by installer defaults and is not bundled in template mirror.
- `ai install` copies bundled templates with create-only semantics (existing files are preserved).

## Non-Negotiables

- Mandatory local enforcement via non-bypassable hooks.
- Required checks include `gitleaks`, `semgrep`, dependency vulnerability checks, and stack checks.
- No direct commits to `main`/`master`.
- Standards cannot weaken framework non-negotiables without explicit risk acceptance.

## Command Contract

- `/commit` -> stage + commit + push current branch.
- `/commit --only` -> stage + commit.
- `/pr` -> stage + commit + push + create PR.
- `/pr --only` -> create PR; if branch is unpushed, warn and offer auto-push; continue with engineer-selected path if declined.
- `/acho` -> stage + commit + push current branch.
- `/acho pr` -> stage + commit + push + create PR.

## Remote Skills

- Default is remote ON with local cache.
- Initial sources: `https://skills.sh/` and `https://www.aitmpl.com/skills`.
- Locking and integrity are stored in `state/sources.lock.json` (checksums + signature metadata scaffolding).

## Context Efficiency

- No hard token cap per category; strict compaction and deduplication are mandatory.
- Every managed doc update includes rationale, expected gain, and potential impact.
- Maintenance agent runs weekly as local report first; PR creation only after approval.
