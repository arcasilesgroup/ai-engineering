# Team Core Standards

## Update Metadata

- Rationale: provide safe team-level extension surface.
- Expected gain: customization without policy drift.
- Potential impact: team docs must follow non-negotiable constraints.

## Purpose

Team-specific standards that extend framework defaults without weakening non-negotiables.

## Allowed Customizations

- Naming and style conventions.
- Additional quality gates.
- Team workflows for review and planning.

## Forbidden Customizations

- Disabling mandatory local enforcement.
- Removing required security checks.
- Allowing direct commits to protected branches.

## Ownership Contract

This file is team-managed and is never overwritten by framework updates.
