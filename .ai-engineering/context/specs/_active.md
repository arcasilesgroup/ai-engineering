# Active Spec

Spec-014: Dual VCS Provider Support + Generic Hardening — started 2026-02-22.

## Quick Resume

1. Read [spec.md](014-dual-vcs-provider/spec.md) — problem, solution, scope, decisions
2. Read [plan.md](014-dual-vcs-provider/plan.md) — architecture, session map, patterns
3. Read [tasks.md](014-dual-vcs-provider/tasks.md) — ordered phases, check checkboxes
4. If done.md exists, the spec is complete — move to the next spec or set active to "none"
5. Check `state/decision-store.json` — decisions already taken (do not re-ask)
6. Check last N lines of `state/audit-log.ndjson` — recent events
