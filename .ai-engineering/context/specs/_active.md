# Active Spec

No spec is currently active. Spec-013 (CLI UX Hardening) completed on 2026-02-11.

## Quick Resume

1. When a new spec is created, update this file with `active: "<spec-slug>"`
2. Read [spec.md](<spec-slug>/spec.md) — problem, solution, scope, decisions
3. Read [plan.md](<spec-slug>/plan.md) — architecture, session map, patterns
4. Read [tasks.md](<spec-slug>/tasks.md) — ordered phases, check checkboxes
5. If done.md exists, the spec is complete — move to the next spec or set active to "none"
6. Check `state/decision-store.json` — decisions already taken (do not re-ask)
7. Check last N lines of `state/audit-log.ndjson` — recent events
