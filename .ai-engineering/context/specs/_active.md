# Active Spec

Current work: [003-governance-enforcement](003-governance-enforcement/spec.md)

## Quick Resume

1. Read [spec.md](003-governance-enforcement/spec.md) — problem, solution, scope, decisions
2. Read [plan.md](003-governance-enforcement/plan.md) — technical approach, architecture, patterns
3. Read [tasks.md](003-governance-enforcement/tasks.md) — ordered phases, check checkboxes
4. No done.md = still in progress
5. Check `state/decision-store.json` — decisions already taken (do not re-ask)
6. Check last N lines of `state/audit-log.ndjson` — recent events
