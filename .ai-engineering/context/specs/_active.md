# Active Spec

No active spec. Spec-014 (Dual VCS Provider Support + Generic Hardening)
completed 2026-02-22 on branch `feat/dual-vcs-provider`.

## Quick Resume

1. To start a new spec, use the `/govern:create-spec` skill.
2. Check `state/decision-store.json` — decisions already taken (do not re-ask).
3. Check last N lines of `state/audit-log.ndjson` — recent events.
