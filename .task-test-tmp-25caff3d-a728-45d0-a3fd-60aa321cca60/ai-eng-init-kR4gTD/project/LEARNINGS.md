# Learnings

Accumulated failures and lessons from building features, mostly written by `/ai-orchestrator`. Every planner, implementer, test writer and reviewer reads **Rules** before starting.

- **Log** is append-only: never edit or delete an entry.
- **Rules** is the distilled version. A lesson is promoted here once it has recurred (2 or more log entries) or caused a human-review rejection or a circuit-breaker stop. Each rule cites the entries it came from.

## Rules

<!-- - R1: <imperative rule>. (from L3, L7) -->

## Log

<!--
### L<n> · YYYY-MM-DD · <feature-slug> #<checkpoint> · <gate: behavior|ui|review|human|circuit-breaker>
- **Failure:** what failed, as the gate reported it
- **Root cause:** why, not just what
- **Fix:** what changed
- **Lesson:** one reusable sentence for next time
- **Tags:** e.g. auth, db, migration, ui, tests, webhooks
