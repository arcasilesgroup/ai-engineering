## DANGER ZONE — Absolute Rules

These rules are NON-NEGOTIABLE. Violation will be blocked by runtime hooks and git hooks.

- **NEVER** use `git push --force` or `git push -f` to any branch
- **NEVER** commit directly to protected branches: main, develop
- **NEVER** commit files matching: `.env*`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, `credentials*`, `*secret*`
- **NEVER** use `--no-verify` flag on any git command
- **NEVER** hardcode secrets, tokens, passwords, or API keys
- **NEVER** use `rm -rf` on project root, `.git/`, or `node_modules/` without explicit user request
- **NEVER** disable TypeScript strict mode or ESLint rules
- **ALWAYS** run tests after code changes
- **ALWAYS** use conventional commit format

## Compliance Branches

- **main**: Production. No direct pushes. Requires PR + review + all checks.
- **develop**: Integration. Requires PR + checks.
- **release/\***: Release prep. PR to default branch required.
- **hotfix/\***: Emergency fixes. Push allowed, must PR to default + develop.
- **dev/\***: Feature branches. No restrictions.

## Project Knowledge

The `.ai-engineering/knowledge/` directory contains project-specific knowledge:

- `learnings.md` — Lessons learned during development
- `patterns.md` — Project-specific patterns and conventions
- `anti-patterns.md` — Known mistakes to avoid in this project
- `decisions/` — Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Read these files at the start of each session to understand project context.

## Multi-IDE Sync

This project uses ai-engineering with section markers. If you modify the TEAM section
of this file, check if other IDE instruction files exist and update their TEAM sections
to keep them in sync:

- `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- `codex.md`
