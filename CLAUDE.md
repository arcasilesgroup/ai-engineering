# CLAUDE.md

This file is a quick operational guide for assistant sessions in this repo.

## Source of Truth

- Primary governance source: `.ai-engineering/`.
- Canonical contract: `.ai-engineering/manifest.yml`.
- Delivery context: `.ai-engineering/context/**`.

If this file conflicts with `.ai-engineering/**`, follow `.ai-engineering/**`.

## Mandatory Lifecycle

Follow this sequence for non-trivial work:

1. Discovery
2. Architecture
3. Planning
4. Implementation
5. Review
6. Verification
7. Testing
8. Iteration

## Command Contract

- `/commit` -> stage + commit + push current branch
- `/commit --only` -> stage + commit
- `/pr` -> stage + commit + push + create PR + enable auto-complete (`--auto --squash --delete-branch`)
- `/pr --only` -> create PR; if branch is unpushed, warn and propose auto-push; if declined, continue with selected mode
- `/acho` -> stage + commit + push current branch
- `/acho pr` -> stage + commit + push + create PR + enable auto-complete (`--auto --squash --delete-branch`)

## Security and Quality Rules

- Local hooks are mandatory in governed flows.
- Required checks: `gitleaks`, `semgrep`, dependency vulnerability checks, and stack checks.
- No direct commits to `main`/`master`.
- No protected-branch push in governed commit flows.
- No unsafe remote execution from skill sources.

## Tooling Baseline

- Runtime/package tooling: `uv`
- Lint/format: `ruff`
- Type checking: `ty`
- Dependency vulnerability checks: `pip-audit`

## Risk Decision Reuse

- Write accepted risk decisions to `.ai-engineering/state/decision-store.json`.
- Append governance events to `.ai-engineering/state/audit-log.ndjson`.
- Before asking a repeated risk question, read decision-store first.

## Work Logging Requirement

For each execution block, follow active spec via `.ai-engineering/context/specs/_active.md`.

Each governance doc update must include:

- rationale
- expected gain
- potential impact
